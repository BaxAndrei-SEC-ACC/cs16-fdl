In a war-torn environment, two teams face off

intricate design offers both open and tight  
spaces for tactical gameplay.  

Counter-Terrorists: Prevent the Terrorists  
from planting the bomb at one of the two  
bomb sites. Defend key areas and stay alert.  

Terrorists: Plant the C4 at either of the bomb  
sites and protect it until detonation.
