aim_map - Aim Training
Map by Johan 'w00d' Bjarnle & Filip 'tntman' Orrby

Terrorists: Eliminate all Counter-Terrorists.

Counter-Terrorists: Eliminate all Terrorists.

Other Notes: A map designed for aim training and 
improving accuracy. Ideal for practicing headshots 
and reaction time in a controlled environment.

History: In 2002, Johan and Filip created aim_map 
to address the lack of aim training maps in Counter-Strike. 
After sharing it at a LAN-party in Sweden, it quickly spread 
and was hosted on hundreds of servers, becoming a staple 
in the CS community.

Have fun!
