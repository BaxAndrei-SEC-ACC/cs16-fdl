Mansion - Hostage Rescue
Map by Magnus Lind

Terrorists: Eliminate all Counter-Terrorists.

Counter-Terrorists: Eliminate all Terrorists.

Other Notes: This map features open areas and
tight hallways, perfect for fast-paced action 
and intense firefights. The round does not end
until one team has been completely wiped out.

Have fun!
