November, 2001:   Despite an unprecedented International coalition 
against Terrorism, the United States is once again under attack.  
Seeking to destroy valuable and sensitive digital information, 
the Tegea Corporation, an International Data Storage Facility, 
has become the focus of terrorist activity. 

Hosting major corporations, banks, and other industrial networks, 
such a disruption could potentially cripple the already struggling 
world economy.  Through the newly established Homeland Defense 
System, Intelligence reports suggest that an impending attack on Building
One of the Tegea World Headquarters is highly probable.


Mission Objectives:

Terrorists:  Locate and destroy one of the two SAN (Storage Area Network) 
server rooms on the second floor. 

Counter-Terrorists: Access the building; secure the SAN servers and 
contain the situation; eliminate any potential threat.
