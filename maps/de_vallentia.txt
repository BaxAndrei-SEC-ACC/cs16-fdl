Map by: JulFisher (julfisher_64@yahoo.fr)  

Briefing:  
Set in the ancient ruins of Vallentia,  
now repurposed as a tourist destination.  
These ruins, discovered in Aquitaine near  
the Basque coast, have become a battleground  
as terrorists target the site.  

Counter-Terrorists: Prevent the Terrorists  
from planting the bomb at either of the  
two bomb sites. Protect the ruins and  
maintain control of critical areas.  

Terrorists: Plant the C4 at one of the two  
bomb sites:  
- Alpha: The construction site of a "restaurant."  
- Beta: The alley in front of the small house with  
  broken shutters.  

The GIGN has been called in for the evacuation,  
and now it's time to act.
